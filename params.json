{"name":"Pydataexplorer","tagline":"A file browser, implemented in python, designed to interactively plot delimited data files in a wxpython GUI interface","body":"![Screen Shot](http://i.imgur.com/RLtV7Cd.png)\r\n\r\n### PyDataExplorer introduction\r\nPyDataExplorer is intended as a simple, easy-to-modify program for interactive exploration of delimited  text data files, such as those commonly produced during various scientific measurements.  It is designed as a GUI file browser with additional functionality to allow realtime data previews in the form of matplotlib plots and spreadsheet-style grid views. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each of the components is designed for modular use within your own code.  As an example of one such implementation, a custom \"open file\" dialog is presented, which pops up the file browser GUI to allow the user to select a file to open.  When looking through files to open in this popup window, the user sees previews of the data within the files, making it easier to ensure that the user is correctly selecting the right data file. \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe following packages are needed in order to run PyDataExplorer:\r\n\r\n* [wxpython](http://www.wxpython.org/)\r\n* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\r\n* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n* [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) - only necessary on Windows computers.  This library is used to allow the Data Explorer the ability to display all possible drive letters on the computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nPyDataExplorer is is free to modify, incorporate into closed-source projects, distribute, and duplicate. Small helper libraries are to be considered public domain, and the core GUI implementation in DataExplorerGui.py is provided under a BSD 2-clause license.  The full license is provided in the source file.\r\n\r\n### Running PyDataExplorer\r\n\r\nTwo simple standalone app programs are provided, and can be run from the command line:\r\n\r\nTo run the standalone Data Explorer, run:\r\n```\r\n$ python DataExplorer.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see a simple demo of the Data Explorer used as a file dialog, run:\r\n```\r\n$ python ExplorerDialogDemo.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you are having any problems, feel free to email jdavidheiser@gmail.com for questions.
