PyDataExplorer
==============

PyDataExplorer is a file browser with additional functionality to allow realtime data previews in the form of matplotlib plots and spreadsheet-style grid views.  It is built to allow modular use of each of the components in your own code - as an example, a custom "open file" dialog is presented, which uses the file browser GUI to allow the user to select a file to open, and that file is previewed in plot and data preview forms right on the open dialog.

The following packages are needed in order to run this code:

wxpython
matplotlib
numpy
pywin32

PyDataExplorer is is free to modify, incorporate into closed-source projects, distribute, and duplicate.
